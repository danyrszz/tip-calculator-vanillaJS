- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This helped me to understand quite a bit more the event listeners, first i was wondering how to make the label to be updated as the user types (and obviously perform the calculations), i got a little stuck here.
First i tried to use keyboard events, but i wasn't satisfied with the result, then i tought "maybe with some kind of 'change' event, to look for any changes on the state of the element". Then i found the "input" event which basically do what i was looking for. The rest was pretty easy. 

Oh by the way it's the first time -in the few projects i've done this far- using media queries!, and i'm still learning grid and flexbox, those two are amazing for laying out!!
